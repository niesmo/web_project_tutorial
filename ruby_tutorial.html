            <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
            <p>This is a tutorial intended for developers who have a basic knowledge of programing including loops, variables, classes, and datatypes. Prior knowledge of Ruby programming is not necessary for these tutorials.</p>
            <p>This set of tutorials assume that you already have Ruby installed on your machine and is ready to use. If you do not have ruby installed on your computer, please follow this <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/">install</a> link before getting started with these tutorial</p>
            <p>Ruby is an Object Oriented Programming Language. In Ruby everything is an object. Characters, numbers, arrays, and everything else is just an object in Ruby.</p>
            

            <hr />        
            <h3 id="irb">Ruby Interpreter (IRB)</h3>
            <p>IRB stands for Interactive Ruby which executes Ruby Code interactively.</p>
            <pre><code>irb(main):001:0> 1+2
=> 3</code></pre>
            <p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we used an online interpreter so that you can follow along and if you want to try them with us, you could easily do so. <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/">repl.it</a></p>
            
            <hr/>

            <h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are simply memory locations that hold data in our program. Variables in Ruby are similar to variables in other programming languages.</p>
            <p>In this section, we are going to talk about Global variables and Constants. If you would like to know more about other kinds of variables, you could go and read the <a href="#classes">Classes</a> section of this tutorials.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Global Variables</h4>
            <p>Global variables are a kind of variables that you can access them from anywhere in your program. They must start with $. It is  best practice that your global variables are all in lowercase and separated with underscore if multiple words.</p>
<pre><code>$total_function_call_count = 0

def add a,b
    $total_function_count+=1
    a+b
end

def sub a,b
    $total_function_count+=1
    a-b
end

def mult a,b
    $total_function_count+=1
    a*b
end

def div a,b
    $total_function_count+=1
    a/b
end

add 1,2
sub 2,1
mult 8,9
div 2,1

puts "How many funciotn calls did we have ? #{$total_function_count}"
</code></pre>
            <div class="tiy">

            </div>

            <h4>Constants</h4>
            <p>Constants are variables that are intended to stay the same all throughout the execution of a program. One great example for constant is the PI number. The number PI should NOT change under any circumstances.</p>
            <p>Constant variables must begin with uppercase letters. It is best practice that the constant variable is in all uppercase. Re-assignign value to a constant will result in a warning (It still does the re-asignment however). It is worth noting that accessing a constant that has not been initialized yet will result in a runtime error. Another thing that is noticable is that you cannot assign a value to a constant variable from within a method. That is considered to be Dynamic Constant Assignment which will result in an error.</p>
<pre><code>#constant variable
PROGRAM_NAME = "Best Tutorials"

def print_program_name
    puts PROGRAM_NAME
end

#setting a constant in a variable => ERROR
=begin
def set_program_name name
    PROGRAM_NAME = name
end
=end

print_program_name #=> will execute fine

            <h3 id="callingfunc">Calling Some Functions</h3>
            
            <p>We talked about how everything is an object in Ruby. Therefore, in order to work with objects, we must call their public methods and that is how we interact with them. Here are some examples.</p>
<pre>
<code>str = "this is an awesome Tutorial"
puts str.capitalize
puts str.length
puts str.slice 11, 7
puts str.slice(11,7).capitalize
puts str[11,7]
puts str[11..18]
puts "There are " + str.count('i').to_s  + ' i\'s in this sentence' 
puts str.insert(18, "-X")
puts str.reverse

my_num = 12345
puts my_num
puts "is even ? " + my_num.even?.to_s
puts "is odd ? " + my_num.odd?.to_s
puts "Next : " + my_num.next.to_s
puts "In binary ? easy " + my_num.to_s(2)
puts "In hex " + my_num.to_s(16)
</code>
</pre>
            <div class="tiy">
                <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/iCb/2">Try it</a>
            </div>
            <p>But again, everything is an object, there is not really a primitive type in Ruby! It is all objects and classes. That means that even numeric values are object. If that is the case, then the operations that we do on numberic values are functions. Take a look at these examples</p>
            <pre><code>my_num = 5
puts my_num.*(3) # my_num*3
puts my_num.+(5) # my_num+5
puts my_num.-(4) # my_num-4
puts my_num./(2.5) # my_num/2.5</code></pre>
            <p>These are called <b>syntactic sugar</b> that Ruby has added for the ease of use.</p>
            <div class="tiy">
                <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/iCm">Try it</a>
            </div>

            <hr />
            <h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
            <p>Methods are probably the most used feature of any programming language ever existed. You can create methods using the following syntax</p>
<pre><code>def method_name [( [arg [= default]]...[, * arg [, &expr ]])]
    expr..
end</code></pre>
            <p>Your methods name must start with a lowercase letter. It is best practice that your method names are all in lowercase and separated with underscore if multiple words are used.</p>
            <p>Note that the last expression in a method is returned unless an explicit return is specified</p>

<pre><code>def hi
    "Hi"
end
    
puts hi</code></pre>
            <div class="tiy">
                <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/iDF/2">Try it</a>
            </div>
            <p>We can have methods that take in arguments as well</p>

<pre><code>#method with 1 argument
def hi name
    "Hi " + name
end

puts hi "Mary"


#method with 2 arguments
def hi name,msg
    "Hi " + name + "\n" + msg
end

puts hi "David", "Welcome to the best tutorial site ever made"    
</code></pre>
            <div class="tiy">
                <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/iDF/2">Try it</a>
            </div>
            <p>This may be a strange concept, but we can have methods that take in as many arguments as we pass it to. These types of methods do exist in other programming languages such as C/C++. printf and scanf are two of the most popular examples of such functions. In Ruby we use an operator called the Splat Operator to indicate such thing. Here is an example</p>

<pre><code>def avg(*num)
   sum = 0
   count = 0
   if num.respond_to?("each")
        num.each do |i|
           sum += i 
           count += 1
        end
    else
        count = 1
        sum = num
   end
   sum/count
end
puts avg 1,2,3
puts avg 2,3,4,5,6
puts avg 1
</code></pre>
            <div class="tiy">
                <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/iDF/2">Try it</a>
            </div>



            <hr/>
            <h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
            <p>
            Classes are objects consisting of methods and variables. Classes can be instantiated to create new objects of that class.
            </p>


<pre><code>#A simple class
class dog #class name is dog

    @age, @color, @name
    
    def bark
        puts("wooof")
    end
end

frodo = Dog.new #creating a Dog object
frodo.bark()
</code></pre>

            
            <p>
                In this example you can see the use of multiple instance variables, those that are unique to a specific object that is created from a class. There's also a simple instance method, which can only be called once a Dog object has been created. 

                However you can also create an object passing values, use static methods, and there's 4 other types of variables in a class. Class, Global, Local, Constants.


            </p>
<pre><code>$global = 5 # global 

class Dog 
    LEGS = 4 #Constant
    @age, @color, @name
    @@numDogs = 0 #class variable

    def initialize(a, c, n) #constructor
        @age, @color, @name = a, c, n
        @@numDogs += 1
    end

    def self. legs
        totalLegs = LEGS * numDogs #totalLegs is local
        return numDogs
    end

    attr_accessor : age #accessor for creating get/set 
end

thorin = Dog.new(89, Grey, "Oaken'sheild")
</code></pre>

            <p>
                You can also use basic Ruby syntax to create get and set methods. Methods that will allow you to access and change variables in a class. These are automatic using attr_accessor and it's sister methods.
            </p>

            <h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
            <p>Modules are a way of grouping different things all together. You can group classes, methods, and constants. One of the biggest advanteges is that they prevent from name clashing. You can have a class with the same name in two different modules without any problems</p>

<pre><code>module Identifier
    statement1
    statement2
    ..................
end</code></pre>
            
            <p>For example, you can have a module that is a wrapper for all your simple mathematic functions</p>

<pre><code>module MyMathModule
    PI = 3.1415
    def MyMathModule.square a
       a*a
    end
    def MyMathModule.pythag(a,b)
        ((a*a)+(b*b))**0.5
    end
end</code></pre>
            <div class="tiy">
                <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/hzg/3">Try it</a>
            </div>
            
            <hr/>
            <h3 id="iterators">Iterators</h3>

            <hr/>
            <h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
            <p>In Ruby arrays can be created in a number of ways. Including many you are familiar with. 
            </p>
<pre><code>arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
arr2 = Array.new 7
arr3 = arr1[2..5]
arr4 = arr3 + arr1
</code></pre>
            
            <p>Here are some useful methods when dealing with arrays. Assume that arr is in it's original condition for each method call.
            </p>
<pre><code>
arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
arr.first           #=> 0
arr.last            #=> 9
arr.take(4)         #=> [0,1,2,3]
arr.length          #=> 6
arr.include?(13)    #=> false
arr.push(6)         #=> [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
arr.pop             #=> [0,1,2,3,4]
arr.shift           #=> [1,2,3,4,5]
arr.unshift(17,18)  #=> [17,18,0,1,2,3,4,5]
arr[3]              #=> 3
arr
</code></pre>

            <hr/>
            <h3 id="hashes">Hashes</h3>
            <p>A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" => "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.</p>
            <p>The order in which you traverse a hash by either key or value may seem arbitrary and will generally not be in the insertion order. If you attempt to access a hash with a key that does not exist, the method will return nil.</p>

            <p>You can create hashes in many different ways. Two of the most commons ways are shown below</p>

<pre><code>my_hash = Hash.new
my_hash = Hash.new 0 #=>all the values are set to zero by default
</code></pre>

            <p>Or you could use the implicit form and define your hash</p>

<pre><code>grades = { "Jane Doe" => 10, "Jim Doe" => 6 }</code></pre>

            <p>In most cases, you are trying to create a structure that will be repeated. For example an array of hashes. each of these hashes are going to have the same form. Therefore, it is best practice to use a symbole instead of a literal as the key. A symbole is defined ONLY ONCE in the execution of your program. As a result, this will be taking significantly less amount of space on the disk, especially if your array grows and have a large amount of objects in it.</p>

<pre><code>options = { :font_size => 10, :font_family => "Arial" }</code></pre>
            <p>But since this form was really common to use, Ruby has a syntactic sugar for it. This is very similar to the way that you define objects in JavaScripts.</p>
<pre><code>options = { font_size: 10, font_family: "Arial" }</code></pre>

            <p>Hashes are commonly used for defining objects. They are passed into the method as an argument, and if they are the last argument passed to the method, no braces are needed</p>

<pre><code>Person.create(name: "John Doe", age: 27)
def self.create(params)
  @name = params[:name]
  @age  = params[:age]
end
</code></pre>

<pre><code>my_hash = {}

my_hash['Nima'] = {f_name: "Nima", l_name: "Esmaili Mokaram", phone: "123-456-7890"}
my_hash['Max'] = {f_name: "Max", l_name: "Maguire", phone: "987-654-3210"}

puts my_hash
puts my_hash.keys
puts my_hash.values

#creating the default values
h = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = "Go Fish: #{key}" }

puts h['c']
h['c'] = "Temp"
puts h['c']
puts h['Nima']

#creating a BAD default value
h = Hash.new ("Default")
h[1].upcase!  #changing the default value! BECAREFUL
h[2]
</code></pre>
